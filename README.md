# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions repository! Here, you'll find my attempts, thoughts, and explanations for various LeetCode problems. Each solution is accompanied by problem statistics, a detailed description, and the code I wrote to solve the problem.

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems on LeetCode. I'm working on these problems to prepare for coding interviews and to keep my problem-solving skills sharp. My goal is to tackle a wide range of challenges, from data structures and algorithms to complex logical problems, to ensure I'm always ready for whatever comes my way in the technical interview arena.

### Why LeetCode?

LeetCode offers a vast array of problems that mimic the types of questions asked in coding interviews by many tech companies. By solving these problems, I'm not only improving my coding skills but also learning to approach problems in more efficient and creative ways. This repository serves as a personal log of my progress and as a resource for anyone looking to enhance their own coding abilities.

## Contributing

While this is a personal project to track my own progress and learning, I'm open to discussions, suggestions, and contributions on how to improve the solutions or explanations provided.
